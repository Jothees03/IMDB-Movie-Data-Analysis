# 🎬 IMDb Database Analysis — Advanced SQL Project

A structured SQL-based project analyzing a simplified version of the IMDb database to uncover trends in movie production, genres, ratings, languages, revenue, and actor performance.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

- Analyze and interpret IMDb-style movie data using advanced SQL.
- Identify patterns in genre popularity, release trends, and rating behavior.
- Derive insights on actors, directors, languages, and revenue data.
- Practice SQL querying across multiple related tables.

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

This project utilizes six interconnected tables:

- `movie`: Contains core movie details (title, year, duration, country, income, etc.)
- `genre`: Genre labels linked to each movie.
- `director_mapping`: Connects movies to their respective directors.
- `role_mapping`: Maps actors and roles to movies.
- `names`: Contains details about actors/directors including birthdates, height, etc.
- `ratings`: Stores average rating, total votes, and median rating for movies.

## 🧠 SQL Concepts Applied

- Inner and outer joins for merging data across tables
- Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX)
- Grouping and filtering for targeted analysis
- Ranking using `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()`
- Subqueries and conditional logic
- Date-based filtering and trend evaluation
